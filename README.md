Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a full-stack web developer with an inclination to backend. Coding has been very transformative in the way I approach things in life, so doing this is just training again and again to become better and learn new things.

### 🚀 Coding Expertise


- Music web-page: developed a comprehensive web-page using React, NodeJS, Cloudinary and MongoDB --> https://grau-music.vercel.app/
- Specialized Back-End Project: developed a specialized Back-End project using NestJS, TypeORM and PostgreSQL --> https://pihenrysimon-latest.onrender.com/api
- Water-system project: currently developing a program to monitor water consumption at Alella Green Tech (Barcelona, Spain)

### 🐙 No-Code Expertise

Before coding, I had 3 different jobs:
- Financial advisor --> working at a finance broker is really cool, you can get to expose yourself, talk to clients, understand complex subjects and try to predict next market movements.
- Finance intern --> really enjoyed my first corporate job (it was at Danone) where I could see first-hand how is it to work at a big company and contribute to a mission greater than myself.
- IT professor --> I ended up where I started working (kind of). Here I had to teach basic stuff to students about Microsoft Excel and basic computer functioning.

### 💡 Interests

I'm deeply interested in:

- Building real-life projects that solve meaningful problems.
- Contributing to efficient and scalable software, particularly in finance or agriculture.

### 📚 Hobbies

Apart from coding, I enjoy:

- Playing tons of sports
- Reading tons of books
- Travelling
