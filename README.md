Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a full-stack web developer with an inclination to backend. Coding has been very transformative in the way I approach things in life, so doing this is just training again and again to become better and learn new things.

### ðŸš€ Expertise


- Music web-page: developed a comprehensive web-page using React, NodeJS, Cloudinary and MongoDB --> https://grau-music.vercel.app/
- Specialized Back-End Project: developed a specialized Back-End project using NestJS, TypeORM and PostgreSQL --> https://pihenrysimon-latest.onrender.com/api
- Water-system project: currently developing a program to monitor water consumption at Alella Green Tech (Barcelona, Spain)

### ðŸ’¡ Interests

I'm deeply interested in:

- Building real-life projects that solve meaningful problems.
- Contributing to efficient and scalable software, particularly in finance or agriculture.

### ðŸ“š Hobbies

Apart from coding, I enjoy:

- Playing tons of sports
- Reading tons of books
- Travelling
